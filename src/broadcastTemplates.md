# Broadcast Email Templates

Three rotating styles for weekly broadcasts. Each broadcast uses a different style to keep emails fresh and varied.

## Style 1: Educational Email

**Format:** Quote → Problem → Why it matters → The tactic → Steps → CTA

**Structure:**
```
Subject: Jimmy Grills Racing — [specific promise / curiosity line]
Preview text: [1 short line that makes them want to open]

Words I like: "[Short quote / 1-liner related to the topic]"

[1-sentence problem/condition]: [What makes the solution necessary?]

Why it matters: [1 sentence that raises stakes / consequence.]

The tactic: [The 1 clear thing to do, in 1-3 sentences.]

How to do it today:
1. [Step]
2. [Step]
3. [Step]

CTA: If you want help with [next step aligned to the email], go here: [Link]

PS: [Either a second reward (link/resource) OR your second CTA.]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Jimmy Grills Racing — The 3-second rule that fixes messy corner entry

Words I like: "Slow in, fast out isn't about going slow — it's about being precise where it matters most."

Most sim racers think corner entry is about braking later. But the real problem is they're not looking far enough ahead.

Why it matters: If your eyes are glued to the car's nose at 180km/h, your brain is reacting to things that already happened. You'll never be smooth or consistent.

The tactic: Force your eyes to the furthest visible point on track. The corner will "slow down" within 3-5 laps.

How to do it today:
1. Pick one corner you struggle with
2. Consciously look at the apex while braking, then shift to the exit before turn-in
3. Repeat for 10 laps — notice how much calmer the corner feels

## Style 2: Case Study Email

**Format:** Quote → Short story/scenario → Takeaway → CTA → Punchy closer

**Structure:**
```
Subject: Jimmy Grills Racing — [Short punchy lesson in 2-5 words]

Words I like: "[Insert short quote that frames the lesson]"

[Headline: The Core Idea in 3-6 Words]

[Write a short story or real scenario in 4-8 sentences. Keep it practical, direct, and slightly conversational. Explain what the problem was, what you did differently, and what happened as a result.]

Takeaway: [Summarize the lesson in 1-3 sentences. Make it feel like a rule someone can apply immediately.]

CTA: [One clear action step for the reader.]
Examples:
- Try this in your next session.
- Implement this for the next 7 days.
- Reply and tell me what you think.
- If you want help applying this, grab the guide here: [LINK]

[Short punchy closer like "Go faster." / "Do it today." / "See you on track."]

Jimmy

PS: [Optional one-liner that reinforces the emotional payoff or outcome]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Jimmy Grills Racing — Double sessions

Words I like: "When it's easy, do more. When it's hard, do different."

Double Sessions

My practice used to feel slow. I'd do one session a day and wonder why I wasn't improving.

So I started doing two focused sessions instead of one long one. First session: work on one specific thing (e.g. trail braking into turn 3). Second session: put the full lap together.

The difference was immediate. Instead of aimlessly lapping, I had two clear objectives and two chances to make progress. Every day became two days of improvement.

If you're stuck on a plateau, it's probably not talent — it's structure.

Takeaway: Split your practice into two focused blocks instead of one vague session. Pick ONE technique to isolate, then run full laps applying it. You'll improve twice as fast.

CTA: Try this in your next session — reply and tell me what you worked on.

See you on track.

Jimmy

PS: The feeling when you nail a corner you've been struggling with for weeks — nothing beats it.

Words I like: "[Short quote]"

[Lesson Title]

[1-2 sentences setting the scene.]

[What went wrong / problem.]

[What you did (or what someone smart did).]

[Result / outcome.]

This taught me an important lesson:

"[One bold rule/principle]"

How to use it:
- [Tip 1]
- [Tip 2]
- [Tip 3]

CTA: [One simple action.]
Try it today / Reply and tell me / Click here / Grab the guide

[Short punchy line]

PS: [Optional one-liner]
```

**Example:**
```
Subject: Jimmy Grills Racing — The overdriving trap

Words I like: "The fastest drivers look like they're going slowly. The slowest drivers look like they're in a movie."

The Overdriving Trap

I was coaching a driver last year who was incredibly fast in sector 1 but always lost time in sectors 2 and 3.

He was overdriving — pushing the car past the grip limit in every corner, sliding through apexes, and overheating the tyres. He'd exit each corner a few km/h slower without realising it.

I told him to try something counterintuitive: drive at 90% effort for 5 laps. Just focus on being smooth and hitting every apex cleanly.

His lap time dropped by 0.8 seconds. Less effort, more speed.

This taught me an important lesson:

"Driving at 90% is faster than driving at 110%."

How to use it:
- Pick your worst sector and drive it at 8/10 effort for 5 laps
- Focus on clean apexes and smooth inputs — not raw speed
- Compare your sector times to your "try-hard" laps

Smooth is fast.

PS: You'd be surprised how much time is hiding in the corners you think you're already good at.
